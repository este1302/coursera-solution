               <p>  <span class="g"> Chicken </span> <br><br><br>
                Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling. 
                Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. 
                Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.
                The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. 
                In developed countries, 
                chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional 
                farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, 
                making them outnumber humans more than two to one.

                <p>   <span class="l"> Beef </span><br><br><br>
                    Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, 
                    while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. 
                    Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and 
                    coronary heart disease, especially when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, 
                    being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.

                <p>   <span class="k"> Sushi </span> <br><br><br>
                    Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, 
                    accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. 
                    Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari .
                    Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. 
                    It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. 
                    Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. 
                    Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
