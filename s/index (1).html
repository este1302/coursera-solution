        <div class="box2"> 
            Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, 
            pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, 
            bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, 
            the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. 
            The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs 
            (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). 
            Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their 
            beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. 
            Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. 
            A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, 
            giving the appearance of a beard.Modern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred specifically for meat production, 
            with an emphasis placed on the ratio of feed to meat produced by the animal. The most common breeds of chicken consumed in the U.S
            are Cornish and White Rock.Chickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. 
            In the U.S., broilers are typically butchered at a young age. Modern Cornish Cross hybrids, for example, 
            are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12 weeks for roasting birds.In factory farming, chickens are routinely administered 
            with the feed additive Roxarsone, an organoarsenic compound which partially decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounded in the 
            flesh of chickens, and in their feces, which are often used as a fertilizer. The compound is used to control stomach pathogens 
            and promote growth. In a 2013 sample conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health of chicken meat from poultry producers 
            that did not prohibit roxarsone, 70% of the samples in the US had levels which exceeded the safety limits as set by the FDA.
            The FDA has since revised its stance on safe limits to inorganic arsenic in animal feed by stating that "any new animal drug that 
            contributes to the overall inorganic arsenic burden is of potential concern".Raw chicken may contain Salmonella. The safe minimum 
            cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services is 165 °F (74 °C) to prevent foodborne illness 
            because of bacteria and parasites.[32] However, in Japan raw chicken is sometimes consumed in a dish called torisashi, which 
            is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi style. Another preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides while 
            the inside remains raw.Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, 
            traditionally grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant 
            variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying.
            Western cuisine frequently has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken
            lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or tacos. Chickens often come with labels such as "roaster", 
            which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of chicken.While these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do 
            not do well when cooked with other methods.Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker "with 
            rib meat". This is a misnomer, as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, 
            removed along with the breast meat. 
            The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped from the bone
            through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken 
            slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast 
            (pectoralis major). In the US, "tenders" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of 
            pectoralis minor are called "chicken mini-fillets".
            Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be simmered with 
            vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock.
            In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups, which are said to be healthy. 
            In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket 
            delicatessen sections as either "chicken frames" or "chicken carcasses" and are purchased for soup or stock purposes.
